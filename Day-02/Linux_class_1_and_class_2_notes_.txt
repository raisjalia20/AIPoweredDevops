What is Infrastructure?
Infrastructure refers to the essential resources and services required to run a company or a project. These include both hardware and software systems that support computing environments.

Components of Infrastructure:
==============================

Servers – Physical or virtual machines that run applications.

Database – Systems used to store and manage data (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

Storage – Persistent data storage (e.g., disks, cloud buckets).

Security – Firewalls, authentication, access control, etc.

Monitoring – Tools to observe performance, errors, uptime (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).

Network – Connectivity infrastructure (LAN, VPN, cloud VPC, etc.).
---------------------------------------------------------

Types of Infrastructure:
=========================

On-Premise (Our Own Data Center)
-----------------

Hardware owned and managed by the organization.

High control, but higher upfront costs and maintenance overhead.

Cloud (Pay-As-You-Go Model)
----------------------

Infrastructure provided by cloud vendors (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.).

You pay only for what you use.

Scalable, flexible, and lower maintenance.


What is an Operating System (OS)?
----------------------------------

--> An Operating System (OS) is software that acts as a mediator between the user and the computer hardware.

--> It allows users to interact with computers and run programs.

--> Without an OS, we cannot use any computer system.

--> It provides an environment (platform) for users to operate and manage hardware and software resources.

🛠️ Examples of tasks enabled by an OS:
Opening applications like Notepad, Calculator, Browsers, etc.

Managing files, memory, and peripheral devices.

🌐 Types of Operating Systems in the Market
-----------------------------------------
Common examples include:

Windows

Linux

macOS

Android

iOS

🪟 Windows Operating System
----------------------------------

Developed by Microsoft (Founded by Bill Gates)

GUI-based (Graphical User Interface)

Primarily a single-user OS

Commercial OS – requires paid licenses

Lower built-in security – anti-virus software is often necessary

Best suited for personal or home use, such as:

Playing games

Watching movies

Internet browsing

Storing files

Attending online classes

❗ Note: Windows is not recommended for enterprise-level operations like application deployment or server hosting.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
🐧 Linux Operating System
============================
Community-developed, free, and open source

Supports multi-user environments

Offers high security

CLI-based (Command Line Interface), though some distros have GUIs

Highly recommended for:

Servers

Application deployment

Infrastructure setup

💡 In real-time IT environments, Linux is the OS of choice for infrastructure and DevOps operations.

📜 History of Linux
=======================
Created by Linus Torvalds

Initially used UNIX OS, but faced limitations and his feedback was not accepted

He discovered Minix OS, which aligned more closely with his ideas

Linus modified Minix and created Linux

Name Origin:
Lin(us) + Min(ux) = Linux
========================

🧬 Linux Distributions (Flavors)
===================================

After Linux was released as open source, many companies downloaded the source code and customized it to create their own versions, known as Linux Distributions.

🔹 Popular Linux Distros:
Amazon Linux

Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)

Ubuntu

CentOS

SUSE Linux

There are over 200+ Linux distributions available today.

✅ Summary
What is an Operating System and why do we need it?

Windows OS – GUI, single-user, commercial, for personal use

Linux OS – CLI, multi-user, open source, secure, for enterprise use

History of Linux – Linus Torvalds' journey from UNIX to Linux

Linux Distributions – Various flavors developed from the base Linux kernel
==============================================================================

Install Git bash
 
https://git-scm.com/downloads

Install Mobaxterm(Optional and only for windows)

https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html

Create a free tier AWS account (Video uploaded in course dashboard follow)

=========================================================================

Linux Files System
-------------------
==> Everything is represented as a file

     1) Directory File (Folder) (starts with d)
     2) Normal file/ ordinary ( starts with -)
     3) Link File ( starts with l)


Linux Commands 
==============
$ clear  --> To clear the screen

$ mkdir telusko  --> create a folder/directory named telusko

$ cd telusko  --> changing our current directory to telusko --> going inside that directory/folder

$ pwd  --> to check my current folder/directory
 
/home/ec2-user/telusko
$ cd ..  --> to come out of directory/folder

$ pwd
/home/ec2-user 

rmdir <directory-name>

$ rmdir telusko  --> to delete empty directory named telusko which is empty

$ rm -rf <directory-name>

$ rm -rf aws  --> To delete a directory/folder which has files in it


$ ls --> display files present in current working directory

$ ls -l --> display files present in current working directory in alphabetical order (a-z) one below the other

$ ls -lr --> display files present in current working directory in alphabetical reverse order(z-a) one below the other

$ ls -lt  --> display files present in current working directory which latest on top 

$ ls -ltr ---> display files present in current working directory with old file on top


--------------------------------------------------------

$ rm <file-name>

$ rm alien.txt --> Delete file which is named as alien

$ ls -l
